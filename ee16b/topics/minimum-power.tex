\section{Minimum power/minimum entropy}

\begin{frame}{Background}
\begin{itemize}
\item Circuit laws part of the "definition" of a circuit model
\item But can also be viewed as constrained optimization on power dissipation
\item Physicists call this "Principle of Minimum Entropy Generation"
    \begin{itemize}
  \item Fixed efficiency $$\implies P \varpropto \sigma$$
      \end{itemize}
\item Use one circuit law as the "constraint", recover the other
    \begin{itemize}
  \item Without both, nothing forces energy into the system
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
